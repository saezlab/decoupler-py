    Multivariate Linear Model (MLM) :cite:`decoupler`.

    This approach uses the molecular features from one observation as the population of samples
    and it fits a linear model with with multiple covariates, which are the weights of all feature sets :math:`F`.

    .. math::

        y^i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1}^{i} + \beta_2 x_{2}^{i} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p}^{i} + \varepsilon

    Where:

    - :math:`y^i` is the observed feature statistic (e.g. gene expression, :math:`log_{2}FC`, etc.) for feature :math:`i`
    - :math:`x_{p}^{i}` is the weight of feature :math:`i` in feature set :math:`F_p`. For unweighted sets, membership in the set is indicated by 1, and non-membership by 0.
    - :math:`\beta_0` is the intercept
    - :math:`\beta_p` is the slope coefficient for feature set :math:`F_p`
    - :math:`\varepsilon` is the error term for feature :math:`i`

       Multivariate Linear Model (MLM) scheme.
       In this example, the observed gene expression of :math:`Sample_1` is predicted using
       the interaction weights of two pathways, :math:`P_1` and :math:`P_2`.
       For :math:`P2`, since its target genes that have negative weights are lowly expressed,
       and its positive target genes are highly expressed,
       the relationship between the two variables is positive so the obtained :math:`ES` score is positive.
       Scores can be interpreted as active when positive, repressive when negative, and inconclusive when close to 0.

    The enrichment score :math:`ES` for each :math:`F` is then calculated as the t-value of the slope coefficients.

    .. math::

        ES = t_{\beta_1} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)}

    Where:

    - :math:`t_{\beta_1}` is the t-value of the slope
    - :math:`\mathrm{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)` is the standard error of the slope

    Next, :math:`p_{value}` are obtained by evaluating the two-sided survival function
    (:math:`sf`) of the Studentâ€™s t-distribution.

    .. math::

        p_{value} = 2 \times \mathrm{sf}(|ES|, \text{df})
