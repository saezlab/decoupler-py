    Pathway RespOnsive GENes for activity inference (PROGENy) :cite:p:`progeny`.

    Wrapper to access PROGENy model gene weights. Each pathway is defined with
    a collection of target genes, each interaction has an associated p-value
    and weight. The top significant interactions per pathway are returned.

    Here is a brief description of each pathway:

    - **Androgen**: involved in the growth and development of the male reproductive organs
    - **EGFR**: regulates growth, survival, migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation in mammalian cells
    - **Estrogen**: promotes the growth and development of the female reproductive organs
    - **Hypoxia**: promotes angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming when O2 levels are low
    - **JAK-STAT**: involved in immunity, cell division, cell death, and tumor formation
    - **MAPK**: integrates external signals and promotes cell growth and proliferation
    - **NFkB**: regulates immune response, cytokine production and cell survival
    - **p53**: regulates cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and tumor suppression
    - **PI3K**: promotes growth and proliferation
    - **TGFb**: involved in development, homeostasis, and repair of most tissues
    - **TNFa**: mediates haematopoiesis, immune surveillance, tumour regression and protection from infection
    - **Trail**: induces apoptosis
    - **VEGF**: mediates angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and cell migration
    - **WNT**: regulates organ morphogenesis during development and tissue repair

    Parameters
    ----------
    %(organism)s
    top
        Number of genes per pathway to return. By default all of them.
    thr_padj
        Significance threshold to trim interactions.
    %(license)s
    %(verbose)s

    Returns
    -------
    Dataframe in long format containing target genes for each pathway with their associated weights and p-values.
